This repo has a basic test application using HTML::FormFu.

In the master branch is a really basic Login form

In the 'advanced' branch there is a more complicated login form that
illustrates one way you can use the TT renderer in FormFu to achieve more
complicated layouts.  In this particular example new templates are added to
put error messages after the input tag rather than before, and support for
help text to be stuck into an elements stash, and subsequently rendered
adjacent to input boxes.
